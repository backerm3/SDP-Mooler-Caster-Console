# The SDP Mooler Caster Console

The SDP Mooler Caster Console is a simple DJ program designed for running live-streaming music shows.
It was originally written for the Stereo Dust Particles group of broadcasters, but could be useful for
many others too.

Right now, I'm just trying to get this project a better home and establish proper version control, so
this repo is likely to be a bit of a mess for a while.  Hopefully this will be cleaned up soon enough.
